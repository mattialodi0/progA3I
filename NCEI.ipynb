However, plentiful solar insolation/surface heating in the vicinity of a dryline fostered widely scattered thunderstorm development by the late afternoon. Strong instability and sufficient organizing wind shear lead to a few of these storms displaying supercellular characteristics and producing reports of large hail initially, owing to steep lapse rates and weak low-level shear (among other factors already mentioned). By the mid-evening, as low-level shear and storm-scale interactions began to increase, a few tornadoes occurred across portions of south-central into southwest Oklahoma. The most significant of these was an EF-1 tornado near the community of Hollister (Tillman County).   \n",

Meanwhile, a stationary front lingered from Southeast Oklahoma into extreme Southwest Arkansas and portions of North Louisiana, which aided in compressional heating and low level moisture pooling, with temperatures climbing into the upper 90s to in excess of 100 degrees. The moisture pooling resulted in minimal mixing of dewpoints, with attendant heat indices ranging from 110-115 degrees each afternoon on July 1st through the 4th. However, slightly cooler and drier air were able to mix into the area on the 5th, resulting in slightly lower heat indices.   \n",

      "A cluster of supercells developed during the late afternoon hours, producing large hail at several locations in north central Alabama. The largest reported hail sized was 2.25 inches in Albertville in Marshall County. These storms also produced wind damage in northeast Alabama.  Then, a secondary batch of thunderstorms, merging at times with the original thunderstorms further south yielded a widespread swath of damaging winds from the northwest tip of Alabama, hard hitting the Shoals/Quad Cities metro area, then pushing through Morgan into Marshall Counties while another wave of wind spread from Madison through Jackson into DeKalb Counties.  Numerous trees and power lines were knocked down in this swath, many landing on homes and vehicles, resulting in at least 3 injuries in the Sheffield, Decatur and Hartselle areas. Other more sporadic wind damage was reported further north. The damaging winds resulted in 20000-30000 without power for a period of time in northwest into north central Alabama. Around 250 damage reports were received from this event in north Alabama.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             412\n",
      "A heat dome continued to strengthen and expand across the eastern CONUS during late June. The upper level pattern was dominated by a large 594 dam Bermuda High over the eastern US with a deep trough over the West Coast. This pattern persisted for several days before the ridge finally broke down and the westerlies advanced further south.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     275\n",
      "A cold front ushered in an arctic airmass on the evening of January 17th, as well as bringing widespread wind and snow to eastern Utah and western Colorado. This arctic airmass was reinforced over the course of the next week by several passing waves with their own associated cold fronts. Temperatures during this period were 15-20 degrees below normal, and in some places close to 30 degrees below normal. With temperatures this cold, any amount of wind would produce a dangerously cold wind chill. The coldest period of this event was January 20th to the 22nd, with temperatures finally beginning to moderate after the 23rd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     221\n",
      "A strong, stationary heat dome brought oppressive heat to the Mid-South in mid to late August. The region was fed by warm, moist air from the Gulf, which elevated dewpoints and thus made heat-index values much higher than the actual air temperature alone. Because cloud cover was suppressed and the ground surface was dry, nighttime cooling was limited, elevating heat stress. The heat dome remained parked for several days, resulting in minimal forecast change or relief.

      "A widespread, long-lived thunderstorm line (bow echo) raced across Ohio and western Pennsylvania on the afternoon and early evening of 29 April 2025. The gusts associated with the line of storms reached above 80 MPH at times, producing widespread damage.||The thunderstorms which would eventually turn into the bow echo began to form over southern OH in the late morning hours. The storms became a line and began to bow out. The storms intensified as the bow moved across western PA in the afternoon. As it reached the Laurel Highlands, it was nearing it's peak intensity. An estimated 400,000 customers were without power in the Pittsburgh region as a result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   185\n",
      "A significant multi-hazard, multi-day event occurred across the Mid-South from April 2, 2025, to April 8, 2025, producing 35 tornadoes, record flooding, and numerous reports of damaging winds and large hail.  A large upper-level trough covered the Western U.S. in early April. A significant piece of energy rotated around the base of the trough and ejected into the Southern Plains and the Middle-Upper Mississippi Valley on April 2nd. A 500 mb jet maximum of 120 knots and a 300 mb jet maximum of 140 knots pushed into Iowa by late afternoon on April 2nd.  Meanwhile, a 992 mb surface low moved into the Upper Mississippi Valley with a trailing cold front pushing toward the Mid-South. A secondary, weaker surface low developed over northeast Arkansas and helped to back surface winds. The warm sector across the Mid-South was potent with surface dewpoints climbing into the upper 60s and MLCAPE values climbing to 2000-3000 J/kg. Increasing upper-level divergence occurred in the entrance region of the upper jet, resulting in strong lift across the Mid-South and storm initiation in the increasingly moist and unstable airmass. Hodographs were long, strongly curved, and supportive of tornadoes. Discrete supercells intensified across the Mid-South during the evening as 0-6 km bulk shear values increased to 60-70 knots, and 0-1 km helicity values increased to 300-400 m2/s2. Fifteen tornadoes occurred from late afternoon on April 2nd through about 2 am on April 3rd, including four EF-3s. This period represented the most significant period of severe weather during the event. ||The cold front stalled across the Mid-South on April 3rd while moist southwesterly flow aloft continued and anomalous precipitable water values prevailed across the region. Heavy rain fell across northern sections of the Mid-South into the morning hours of April 3rd. Rainfall amounts of 3-4 inches were common across east-central Arkansas, West Tennessee, and extreme northwest Mississippi, along with scattered instances of flash flooding. By the afternoon of April 3rd, the airmass south of the stalled front destabilized and storms strengthened thanks to a 90-knot mid-level jet maximum moving through Missouri. These storms produced wind damage, large hail, flash flooding, and a tornado east of Corinth. Heavy rain continued into the early morning hours on April 4th when the front eventually lifted north of the area, resulting in a relative lull during the day on April 4th.    173\n",
      "A major and historic multi-day severe weather event unfolded across Middle Tennessee during early April 2025. This event began during the afternoon hours of April 2nd and continued through April 6th. These first couple rounds of thunderstorms brought damaging winds and large hail along with a tornado risk. The corridor from southwest Middle Tennessee into the Nashville metro area was hit particularly hard with multiple supercells training for several hours. Large hail was reported, particularly with the early thunderstorms, with hail sizes nearing three inches. A couple of tornadoes were also confirmed with the strongest being an EF-1 tornado in Wilson County. A brief break was received on April 4th, but the event ended with a potent line of thunderstorms sweeping east through the area April 5th and into the early morning hours of April 6th. This final round of thunderstorms brought a wide swath of damaging winds to several Middle Tennessee counties, including Perry, Humphreys, Dickson, Cheatham, Davidson, Sumner, Wilson, Macon, and Trousdale counties. Widespread 60-70 mph winds were common, however, embedded microbursts likely produced winds up to 90 mph in some spots. Before this line exited the area, it was responsible for producing one last EF-1 tornado in Grundy County. ||These multiple rounds of thunderstorms were also responsible for widespread flooding and flash flooding. By the end of this event, highest rainfall totals were received across the northwest corner of Middle Tennessee and into the Nashville metro area where observations and radar estimates showed 6 to 12 inches of rain. Fortunately, the brief break in activity on April 4th likely prevented more significant flooding, but widespread reports of road closures and streams and creeks spilling out of banks were still received. River flooding was also a widespread issue with sixteen river gauges reaching minor flood stage and six river gauges reaching moderate flood stage. ||Fortunately, no reports of injuries or fatalities were received over this prolonged severe weather event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         168\n",
